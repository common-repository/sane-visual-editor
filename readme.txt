== Description ==

Locks down the TinyMCE visual editor with a sane set of buttons that will help your authors to not insert disruptive styles.

3rd-party buttons are maintained, so your other plugins should keep working if they add buttons.

== Installation ==

1. Upload the `sane-visual-editor` folder to your `/wp-content/plugins/` directory

2. Activate the "Sane Visual Editor" plugin in your WordPress administration interface

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Can I customize which buttons are shown? =

You could, but that somewhat defeats the purpose of this plugin. Examine how my plugin is written and you'll see how to filter which buttons are shown.

= Why did my plugin's extra button(s) disappear? =

I've made every effort to maintain 3rd-party buttons, but some plugins might be doing it wrong. Leave a note [in the forums](http://wordpress.org/tags/sane-visual-editor?forum_id=10).

== Screenshots ==
